# Basic challanges

## For getting more comfortable with JavaScript

### What I learned from these challanges:

1. Count occurrences
   - string.split() method
2. Count vowels
   - can use regex with string.replace()
3. Find max number
   - reminder Math library exists
   - spread operator: arr2 = [...arr1, 4, 5, 6]
4. Get sum
   - how to export functions
   - how to write and run tests usig jest
5. Reverse string
   - strings in JS are immutable, meaning that individual characters within a string cannot be modified directly
   - array.reverse() method
   - array.join() method
6. Palindrome
   - string.toLowerCase() method
   - can replace with empty string to remove characters
7. Title case
   - regex!!!
   - '/' delimiter
   - '\b' word boundary
   - '\w' word character, matches the first letter of each word
   - 'g' global flag
